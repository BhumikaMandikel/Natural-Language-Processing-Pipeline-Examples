# Natural Language Processing Pipeline Examples

A collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) examples using Hugging Face Transformers library. This project demonstrates various NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, text classification, text generation, and more.

## Overview

This project showcases the power and simplicity of Hugging Face's pipeline API for common NLP tasks. Each example demonstrates a different capability, from analyzing emotions in text to generating new content and extracting information.

## Features

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Analyzes the emotional tone of text input, determining whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Perfect for understanding customer feedback, social media posts, or any textual content where emotional context matters.

### 2. Zero-Shot Classification
Classifies text into categories without prior training on those specific categories. This powerful feature allows you to categorize content into custom labels like 'education', 'politics', or 'entertainment' without retraining the model.

### 3. Text Generation
Generates coherent and contextually relevant text continuations from a given prompt. Uses state-of-the-art language models to create human-like text based on the input provided.

### 4. Fill-in-the-Mask
Predicts missing words in sentences, useful for text completion, spell checking, or understanding context. The model suggests the most likely words to fill masked positions in text.

### 5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifies and classifies named entities in text such as person names, organizations, locations, and other important entities. Grouped entities provide cleaner, more organized results.

### 6. Question Answering
Extracts answers from provided context based on specific questions. This feature enables building intelligent systems that can answer questions from documents or knowledge bases.

### 7. Text Summarization
Automatically creates concise summaries of longer text passages, preserving the key information while reducing length. Ideal for processing large documents or articles.

## Prerequisites

Before running the examples, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- transformers library
- torch or tensorflow (depending on your preference)
- Additional dependencies may be required for specific models

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

For GPU support (optional but recommended for better performance):

```bash
pip install transformers torch torchvision torchaudio
```

## Usage Examples

The project includes examples for:

- Analyzing sentiment of single and multiple text inputs
- Classifying text into custom categories without training
- Generating text continuations with different models and parameters
- Filling in masked words in sentences
- Extracting named entities from text
- Answering questions based on provided context
- Summarizing longer text passages

## Model Information

The examples use various pre-trained models:

- **Default sentiment analysis**: Uses BERT-based models fine-tuned for sentiment classification
- **DistilGPT2**: A lighter, faster version of GPT-2 for text generation
- **Default fill-mask**: Typically uses RoBERTa or similar masked language models
- **Default NER**: Uses models trained on standard NER datasets
- **Default QA**: Uses models fine-tuned on question-answering datasets
- **Default summarization**: Uses models specifically trained for text summarization

## Performance Notes

- First run may be slower due to model downloading
- Models are cached locally after first download
- GPU acceleration significantly improves performance for longer texts
- Some models may require substantial memory for larger inputs

## Use Cases

This collection is perfect for:

- **Content Analysis**: Understanding sentiment and topics in social media, reviews, or feedback
- **Content Generation**: Creating drafts, completing sentences, or brainstorming ideas
- **Information Extraction**: Finding specific entities or answering questions from documents
- **Document Processing**: Summarizing reports, articles, or research papers
- **Educational Projects**: Learning about NLP and experimenting with different models
